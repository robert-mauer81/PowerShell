#Test

#This post started as a test to understand how the website works.  I figured while I'm in here I will will include a script that will also test the connection to all the Computer objects in your AD DS Enviroment. 

Get-ADComputer -Filter * | ForEach-Object {
    $computerName = $_.Name
    Test-Connection -ComputerName $computerName -Count 1
}
